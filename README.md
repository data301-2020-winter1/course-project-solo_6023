## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Do you enjoy paying for gas? Me too! Mainly because I really like looking at sites like Gasbuddy and comparing prices. Looking at the differences between two stations is really interesting to me! What I'm not a fan of is paying for gas. Personally I drive a big dumb SUV because I bought my car based solely on if I could sleep in it comfortably. By that metric, I chose well! In terms of efficiency? Not so much. I do, however, like comparing the efficiency of cars that aren't mine, just to see what I'm missing out on. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset comes from the government of the United States of America. This data is provided to the public in order to give an unbiased analysis of the efificiency of different car models. Information is published for each model year of vehicle, and I have specifically pulled the information for the 2020 model year, which was collected as the vehicles were realeased over the period of 2019-2020. The dataset includes car model and manfucaturer in a single attribute, engine and drivetrain information, and average "MPG" or Miles driven per gallon of fuel consumed. 

## Team Members
